# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version Numbering

This project uses a three-number versioning system (X.Y.Z):

X (Major): Breaking changes, major feature overhauls
Y (Minor): New features, significant improvements
Z (Patch): Bug fixes, minor improvements

Example: Version 1.2.3

1: Major version
2: Minor version
3: Patch version

When to increment:

Major (X): When making incompatible changes that might break existing functionality
Minor (Y): When adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
Patch (Z): When making backward-compatible bug fixes

## Making Changelog Entries For New Changes in Development

Add changes under the [Unreleased] section

Categorize them under appropriate headers:

Added for new features

Changed for changes in existing functionality

Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features

Removed for removed features

Fixed for bug fixes

Security for vulnerability fixes

Technical for technical changes/dependencies

Keep entries concise but descriptive

## When Releasing a Version

Convert the [Unreleased] section to a version number with date (e.g., [1.0.0] - 2024-01-20)

Create a new empty [Unreleased] section at the top

## General Rules

Newest changes always go at the top of the file

Each version should be in descending order (newest to oldest)

Group related changes under the same category

Use bullet points for each entry

## Development Workflow

For Every Code Change:

ALWAYS add an entry to the [Unreleased] section in this changelog

Write clear, descriptive change notes

Categorize changes appropriately using the headers above

Commit changes with meaningful commit messages

For Version Releases:

Move [Unreleased] changes to a new version section with today's date

Update version number in ProjectSettings.asset (bundleVersion)

Create a git tag for the version

Create a new empty [Unreleased] section at the top

## Release Process
