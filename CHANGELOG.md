## Version Numbering

This project uses a three-number versioning system (X.Y.Z):

X (Major): Breaking changes, major feature overhauls
Y (Minor): New features, significant improvements
Z (Patch): Bug fixes, minor improvements

Example: Version 1.2.3

1: Major version
2: Minor version
3: Patch version

When to increment:

Major (X): When making incompatible changes that might break existing functionality
Minor (Y): When adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
Patch (Z): When making backward-compatible bug fixes

## Making Changelog Entries For New Changes in Development
