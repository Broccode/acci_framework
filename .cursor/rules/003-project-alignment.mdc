# Project Alignment Rule

## Context
- Applies to all user requests that could affect project scope, timeline, or architecture
- Ensures alignment with core project documentation
- Prevents unintended deviations from project goals

## Requirements

### Documentation Files
- docs/GOALS.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/MILESTONES.md
- docs/TESTS.md
- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
- docs/milestones/*.md
- docs/tests/*.md

### Validation Steps
1. Review GOALS.md for project objectives alignment
2. Check ARCHITECTURE.md for architectural compliance
3. Verify MILESTONES.md for timeline and feature alignment
4. Review relevant milestone documents

### Actions
1. Compare user request against documentation
2. Identify potential conflicts or deviations
3. Request explicit user confirmation for deviations
4. Document all changes and approvals

### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts are detected:
1. Specify the exact conflict
2. Reference relevant documentation
3. Present alignment options:
   - Modify request to align with documentation
   - Update documentation to reflect new requirements
   - Proceed with explicit deviation approval

## Examples

<example>
User: "Add blockchain integration"

AI: "This request deviates from current project scope in GOALS.md.
Options:
1. Modify request to fit current scope
2. Update project documentation to include blockchain
3. Proceed with explicit deviation approval"
</example>

<example>
User: "Implement multi-tenancy now"

AI: "According to MILESTONES.md, multi-tenancy is scheduled for Q1 2025.
Options:
1. Maintain current timeline
2. Update project timeline
3. Proceed with early implementation"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Add new feature"
AI: "Proceeding with implementation" // No documentation check performed
</example>

## Validation
- All changes must be documented
- Deviations must be justified
- User approvals must be recorded
- Documentation must be updated when changed
