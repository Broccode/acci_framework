# ARCHITECTURE.md

This document is based on the arc42 template and describes the architecture of our Enterprise Application Framework. It is designed to be accessible for non-technical stakeholders while providing sufficient detail for the development team.

## 1. Introduction and Goals

**Objective:**
Our framework aims to provide a flexible, secure, and scalable foundation for various business applications. It supports rapid development, smooth operation, and continuous expansion of software solutions.

**Key Drivers:**

- Flexibility and reusability
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance (e.g., GDPR)
- Scalability, high availability, and disaster recovery
- Seamless integration with existing systems (e.g., HR, SMTP, monitoring)
- Extensibility via a modular, plugin-based architecture

---

## 2. Constraints and Requirements

- **Technological Constraints:**
  - Adoption of modern technologies (e.g., Rust, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
  - Integration with existing IT environments (APIs, SSO, SMTP, monitoring)

- **Regulatory Requirements:**
  - Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR)
  - Adherence to security standards (OWASP Top 10, ISO 27001)

- **Operational Requirements:**
  - High availability and disaster recovery strategies
  - Continuous maintenance and update processes

---

## 3. Scope and Context

**System Scope:**  
The framework covers the following areas:

- **User Management:** Authentication, authorization, and user profile management
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Isolated tenant data with scalable infrastructure
- **License Management:** Token-based licensing with flexible models and monitoring
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Multi-language support and cultural formatting
- **Core Architecture & Domain Modeling:** Support for Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event Sourcing, and CQRS
- **API & Integration:** Dual API exposure (REST & GraphQL) with versioning and documentation
- **Plugin Architecture & Workflow Integration:** Modular extensibility for custom business logic

**External Systems:**  
Integration with HR/Directory Services, SMTP servers, monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios), and identity providers (e.g., Keycloak).

---

## 4. Solution Strategy

Our architecture leverages modern, modular concepts:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Clear modeling of business domains.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** A shared platform with isolated data per tenant.
- **Event Sourcing & CQRS:** Storing state changes as events for traceability.
- **Plugin Architecture:** Extensible business logic via modular plugins.
- **Dual API Exposure:** Providing both REST and GraphQL interfaces.
- **Security & Compliance:** Integrated SBOM management, regular audits, and end-to-end encryption.

## 5. Building Block View

### 5.1 Container and Component Overview

**Main Containers:**  

- **API Container:** Hosts authentication/authorization services and the API gateway.  
- **Business Logic Container:** Implements DDD, Event Sourcing, and CQRS functionalities.  
- **Database Container:** Uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage, supported by Redis for caching.  
- **Integration Container:** Manages interfaces to external systems (SMTP, monitoring, HR/Directory Services).

**Key Components:**  

- **User Management Module:** Manages users, sessions, and multi-factor authentication.  
- **License Management Module:** Handles license tokens, validation, and monitoring.  
- **Internationalization Module:** Supports dynamic language switching and cultural formatting.  
- **Plugin & Workflow Engine:** Provides extendable modules for business logic and workflow integration.

---

## 6. Runtime View

**Typical Flow:**  

- A user logs in via the interface; authentication is handled through SSO/OAuth2.
- API calls are routed through the API gateway to appropriate modules.
- State changes are recorded using Event Sourcing and accessed via CQRS.
- Internal components communicate via well-defined APIs, while monitoring tools continuously track system health.

---

## 7. Deployment View

**Deployment Environment:**  

- **Containerization:** Utilizes Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Orchestration:** Supported by load balancers (e.g., Traefik) and service discovery (e.g., Consul).
- **Cloud Integration:** Scalable deployment in cloud environments, with automated backups and disaster recovery.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Employs rollbacks, health checks, and automated update processes.

---

## 8. Cross-Cutting Concepts

- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, regular security audits, and SBOM management.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Structured logging with correlation IDs, RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration), and integrated alerting.
- **Internationalization:** Multi-language support with cultural formatting.
- **Performance:** Caching strategies, load balancing, retry policies, and circuit breakers.
- **Compliance:** Data protection (GDPR), adherence to security standards, and regular audits.

---

## 9. Architectural Decisions

- **Technology Selection:** Using Rust for backend services due to its performance and security benefits.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Embracing Multi-Tenancy, Domain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.
- **API Strategy:** Dual API exposure (REST and GraphQL) with versioning.
- **Security Strategy:** Integrated license management, SBOM, end-to-end encryption, and multi-factor authentication.

---

## 10. Quality Requirements

- **Security:** Adherence to high security standards, regular audits, and automated vulnerability scanning.
- **Scalability:** Ability to dynamically scale with growing user and tenant loads.
- **Availability:** High availability through redundant systems and robust disaster recovery.
- **Maintainability:** Well-documented code, modular architecture, and comprehensive developer guides.
- **Performance:** Optimized through caching, load balancing, and continuous monitoring.

---

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

- **Complex External Integrations:** Challenges in seamlessly incorporating HR, SMTP, and monitoring systems.
- **Technological Dependencies:** Reliance on specific tools and frameworks (e.g., Rust, Docker).
- **Compliance Risks:** Ongoing adjustments to meet evolving data protection and security requirements.
- **Technical Debt:** Potential challenges in maintenance and updates with rapid expansion.

---

## 12. Glossary

- **Multi-Tenancy:** Architecture where multiple tenants operate on a shared platform with isolated data.
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design):** Approach to modeling complex business domains.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separation of read and write operations.
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):** Detailed inventory of all components in a software product.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect:** Standards for authentication and authorization.

## 13. Summary

Our Enterprise Application Framework combines modern architectural approaches such as Multi-Tenancy, DDD, Event Sourcing, and a modular plugin architecture to deliver a flexible, secure, and scalable platform. With robust integration interfaces, high availability, comprehensive monitoring, and a strong focus on security and compliance, it provides an ideal foundation for building future-proof business applications.
