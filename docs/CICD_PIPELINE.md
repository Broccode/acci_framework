# CI_CD_PIPELINE.md

## Overview

This document outlines the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Enterprise Application Framework, detailing automated build, test, and deployment processes, along with integration into DevOps tools.

## Pipeline Components

- **Version Control:**  
  - Utilize Git for source code management with feature branching and pull requests.
- **Automated Builds:**  
  - Trigger builds on code commits using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Automated Testing:**  
  - Run unit, integration, and performance tests during the build process.
- **Deployment Automation:**  
  - Use Docker and Docker Compose to deploy containerized applications.
- **Environment Management:**  
  - Separate pipelines for development, staging, and production environments.

## CI/CD Steps

1. **Code Commit:**  
   - Code is pushed to the repository; CI is triggered automatically.
2. **Build Phase:**  
   - Code is compiled using the nightly Rust toolchain.
   - Linting and static analysis are performed.
3. **Test Phase:**  
   - Execute the complete test suite, including unit, integration, property-based, security, and performance tests.
4. **Artifact Creation:**  
   - Build Docker images and tag them appropriately.
5. **Deployment Phase:**  
   - Automated deployment to staging, followed by manual approval for production deployment.
6. **Monitoring & Rollback:**  
   - Post-deployment monitoring is conducted, with rollback strategies in place for failures.

## DevOps Tools

- **CI/CD Server:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for scaling.
- **Monitoring:** Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for continuous system health monitoring.

## Conclusion

A well-designed CI/CD pipeline ensures rapid feedback, consistent deployments, and high code quality, enabling efficient collaboration and continuous improvement.
