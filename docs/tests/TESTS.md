# Testing Strategy Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our testing strategy and links to detailed documentation for each testing aspect. Our testing approach ensures high code quality, reliability, and maintainability of the Enterprise Application Framework.

## Test Categories

### [Unit Tests](unit-tests.md)

- Individual function and component testing
- Co-located with production code
- No external dependencies
- Fast execution for immediate feedback

### [Integration Tests](integration-tests.md)

- Testing component interactions
- Located in `/tests` directory
- Controlled external dependencies
- Container-based testing

### [Property-Based Tests](property-tests.md)

- Automated test case generation
- System invariant verification
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Using proptest framework

### [Performance Tests](performance-tests.md)

- Benchmark testing
- Load testing
- Scalability verification
- Using criterion framework

### [Security Tests](security-tests.md)

- Fuzzing tests
- Security boundary testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing patterns

### [Mutation Tests](mutation-tests.md)

- Code quality verification
- Test suite effectiveness
- Automated mutation analysis
- Configuration and best practices

## Test Infrastructure

### Directory Structure

```
/tests
├── src/
│   ├── helpers/    # Common test utilities
│   ├── fixtures/   # Test data and setups
│   └── mocks/      # Mock implementations
└── integration/    # Integration tests
```

### Common Tools and Dependencies

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["full", "test-util"] }
proptest = { workspace = true }
testcontainers = { workspace = true }
wiremock = { workspace = true }
fake = { workspace = true }
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation

2. **Test Quality**
   - High coverage requirements
   - Mutation testing verification
   - Regular test suite maintenance

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated test execution
   - Coverage reporting
   - Performance benchmark tracking

## Getting Started

1. Run the complete test suite:

   ```bash
   cargo test --all-features
   ```

2. Run integration tests:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test '*'
   ```

3. Generate test coverage:

   ```bash
   cargo llvm-cov --out Xml
   ```
