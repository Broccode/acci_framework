# DEPLOYMENT_AND_OPERATIONS.md

## Overview

This document outlines the strategies and processes for deploying the Enterprise Application Framework to production, along with ongoing operational management. It covers deployment strategies, configuration management, backup and recovery plans, and monitoring & logging practices.

## Deployment Strategies

- **Rolling Deployments:** Update services incrementally to minimize downtime.
- **Blue/Green Deployments:** Maintain two identical environments (blue and green) to allow seamless switchovers.
- **Canary Releases:** Gradually roll out new changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.

## Configuration Management

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment-specific configurations for sensitive data and operational parameters.
- **Configuration Files:** Manage configurations with version-controlled files.
- **Secret Management:** Integrate secure storage solutions for API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.

## Backup & Recovery

- **Regular Backups:** Automate database and configuration backups at defined intervals.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Define clear recovery processes and roles for restoring services in case of critical failures.
- **Testing:** Periodically test backups and recovery processes to ensure data integrity and rapid restoration.

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Metrics Collection:** Utilize tools such as Prometheus for real-time monitoring of system metrics.
- **Log Aggregation:** Centralize logs using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar tools for efficient troubleshooting.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for key performance indicators (KPIs) and failure conditions.

## Conclusion

A robust deployment and operations strategy ensures minimal downtime, rapid recovery, and continuous monitoring of system health. This documentation should be updated as new tools and processes are adopted.
