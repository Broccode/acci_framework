# MVP Login/Logout Plan (Version 1.0)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this plan is to define the basic implementation of login and logout functionality for our Enterprise Application Framework as part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This initial release will allow us to validate our user management concept and gather valuable feedback on usability and security.

## 2. Scope

This MVP includes:

- **Login:**  
  A basic login form where users can sign in using a username and password.
- **Logout:**  
  A function to securely end a user session.
- **UI Integration:**  
  A simple user interface built with Leptos for the login/logout process.
- **Session Management:**  
  Basic handling of user sessions.

Not included in this version:

- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced security features (e.g., password reset, account lockout)
- Complex UI design elements (these will be enhanced in later iterations)

## 3. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Users can log in using a simple login form.
- Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the homepage.
- Users can log out via a logout button.
- Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**  
  Basic security measures, such as encrypted transmission of login data (HTTPS).
- **Performance:**  
  Response times should be under 2 seconds for login and logout actions.
- **Usability:**  
  A simple, intuitive UI that is accessible to non-technical users.

## 4. Milestones and Timeline

- **Analysis and Planning:** 1 week
- **UI Design and Prototyping:** 1 week
- **Implementation of Login Feature:** 2 weeks
- **Implementation of Logout and Session Management:** 1 week
- **Testing (Unit and Integration Tests):** 1 week
- **Feedback Collection and Iteration:** 1 week

Total Duration: Approximately 7 weeks (iterative adjustments based on feedback)

## 5. Tasks and Responsibilities

- **Product Management:**  
  Define requirements and approve functionality.
- **UI/UX Designers:**  
  Create mockups and prototypes for the login/logout interface.
- **Development Team (Backend and Frontend):**  
  Implement the login/logout functionality and integrate it with Leptos; implement basic security measures (HTTPS, session management).
- **QA (Quality Assurance):**  
  Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and usability tests.
- **DevOps:**  
  Ensure smooth deployments in test and production environments.

## 6. Success Criteria

- **Functionality:**  
  Users can successfully log in and log out.  
  Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
- **Performance:**  
  Response times remain below 2 seconds.
- **User Feedback:**  
  Positive feedback regarding the ease of use of the login/logout process.
- **Security:**  
  Basic security standards are met (e.g., encrypted transmission).

## 7. Next Steps

- Hold a kick-off meeting with all stakeholders to discuss details.
- Set up the development environment and present the initial UI prototype.
- Implement iteratively with continuous feedback collection.
- Plan for future features (e.g., password reset, multi-factor authentication) based on user feedback.
