# Section 6: Runtime View

## Overview

This document details the runtime view of our framework, describing the typical operational flow and interactions between components during system execution.

## Typical Flow

- **User Interaction:**  
  A user accesses the system through a user interface and initiates a login. Authentication is managed via SSO/OAuth2.
- **API Gateway Processing:**  
  Requests are routed through the API gateway to the appropriate modules (e.g., user management, business logic).
- **Business Logic Execution:**  
  Core functionalities are executed within the business logic container using patterns like Event Sourcing and CQRS. State changes are captured as events.
- **Data Persistence and Retrieval:**  
  The database container manages persistent storage using PostgreSQL, with Redis providing fast caching.
- **Inter-Component Communication:**  
  Internal components communicate via defined APIs to ensure efficient data exchange and process coordination.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:**  
  Integrated monitoring tools continuously track system health and performance, triggering alerts as needed.

## System Behavior

This view illustrates how the system behaves under normal operation, ensuring responsiveness, security, and scalability through coordinated component interactions.

## Conclusion

The runtime view offers insight into the operational dynamics of the framework, highlighting the flow of requests and data and the mechanisms that ensure robust performance and reliability.
