# Section 9: Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document provides an extensive description of the key architectural decisions made for our framework. It explains the rationale behind our technology choices, design patterns, and strategic approaches.

## Key Decisions

- **Technology Stack:**  
  The backend is built using Rust for its performance and safety benefits. Docker is used for containerization to ensure portability and consistency.
- **Architectural Patterns:**  
  The design employs Multi-Tenancy, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event Sourcing, and CQRS to ensure scalability, traceability, and clear separation of concerns.
- **API Strategy:**  
  Dual API exposure via REST and GraphQL (with versioning) meets diverse client needs while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Security Strategy:**  
  Integrated robust security measures include multi-factor authentication, SBOM management, end-to-end encryption, and regular security audits.
- **Integration Approach:**  
  A well-defined API and plugin architecture facilitate seamless integration with external systems and enable easy extension of functionality.

## Rationale

Each decision was driven by the need for high performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability:

- **Rust** offers strong safety guarantees and excellent performance.
- **DDD, Event Sourcing, and CQRS** provide accurate business modeling and transparent state management.
- **Dual API Exposure** ensures flexibility for different types of clients.
- **Robust Security Measures** protect the system and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Conclusion

These architectural decisions form the backbone of our framework, balancing innovation, performance, and maintainability to meet both current and future demands.
