# Section 7: Deployment View

## Overview

This document describes the deployment view of our framework, outlining the environments and processes used for delivering and updating the system.

## Deployment Environment

- **Containerization:**  
  The framework is packaged as Docker containers, using Docker Compose for local development and orchestration.
- **Orchestration and Load Balancing:**  
  The system supports deployment behind load balancers (e.g., Traefik) and utilizes service discovery (e.g., Consul) for dynamic scaling.
- **Cloud Integration:**  
  Designed for scalable cloud deployment, the framework includes automated backup strategies and disaster recovery mechanisms.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments:**  
  Implemented via rollbacks, health checks, and automated update processes to ensure continuous availability.

## Deployment Process

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  Changes are integrated via automated pipelines that include testing, versioning, and deployment scripts.
- **Configuration and Secret Management:**  
  Secure management of environment variables, secrets, and configuration settings is handled by deployment scripts.
- **Monitoring and Rollback:**  
  Continuous monitoring during deployment allows for immediate detection of issues and triggers automated rollbacks if necessary.

## Conclusion

This deployment view outlines how our framework is delivered and maintained in production environments, ensuring high availability, scalability, and minimal downtime.
