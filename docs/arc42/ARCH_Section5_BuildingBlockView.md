# Section 5: Building Block View

## Overview

This document provides an extensive description of the building block view for our framework. It outlines the primary containers and components that form the system’s structure, detailing their roles and interactions.

## Main Containers

- **API Container:**  
  Hosts authentication and authorization services along with the API gateway. It routes incoming requests to appropriate modules.
- **Business Logic Container:**  
  Implements core functionalities based on Domain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.
- **Database Container:**  
  Utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent storage, with Redis serving as a caching layer to enhance performance.
- **Integration Container:**  
  Manages communication with external systems (e.g., SMTP, monitoring, HR services) via defined APIs.

## Key Components

- **User Management Module:**  
  Handles user authentication, multi-factor authentication, and session management.
- **License Management Module:**  
  Manages license token generation, validation, and monitoring with flexible licensing models.
- **Internationalization Module:**  
  Supports dynamic language switching, cultural formatting, and RTL language support.
- **Plugin and Workflow Engine:**  
  Enables extendable business logic through a plugin architecture and integrates with workflow engines for complex processes.

## Interactions

The building blocks interact via well-defined APIs and messaging patterns, ensuring loose coupling and high cohesion among components.

## Conclusion

This view provides a clear picture of our framework’s internal structure, highlighting the key containers and components that work together to deliver a robust and flexible system.
