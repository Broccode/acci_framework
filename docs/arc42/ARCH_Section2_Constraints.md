# Section 2: Constraints and Requirements

## Overview

This document details the constraints and requirements that influence the design and implementation of our Enterprise Application Framework. It covers technological, regulatory, and operational factors that shape our solution.

## Technological Constraints

- **Modern Technology Adoption:**  
  The framework must leverage current technologies such as Rust, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis to ensure performance and reliability.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:**  
  The design must accommodate integration with legacy systems and third-party services (e.g., APIs, SSO, SMTP, monitoring tools).

## Regulatory Requirements

- **Data Protection:**  
  Compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR is mandatory. This includes implementing data minimization, encryption, and regular audits.
- **Security Standards:**  
  Adherence to industry security standards such as OWASP Top 10 and ISO 27001 is required to safeguard sensitive data and ensure overall system integrity.

## Operational Requirements

- **High Availability:**  
  The system must be designed for minimal downtime, with redundancy and failover mechanisms in place.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  Effective backup and recovery strategies must be implemented to ensure quick restoration in case of system failure.
- **Continuous Maintenance and Updates:**  
  There should be provisions for ongoing support, updates, and security patches to keep the framework current and secure.

## Conclusion

By understanding these constraints and requirements, we can design a framework that meets both technical and business needs while ensuring compliance and robust operational performance.
