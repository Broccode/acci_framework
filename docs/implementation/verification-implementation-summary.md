# Verification Implementation Summary

## Overview

The verification system has been implemented to provide secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) using verification codes sent via Email or SMS. This complements the existing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) implementation, providing more options for MFA in the ACCI Framework.

## Components Implemented

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /auth/verify/send`: Sends verification codes to users
   - `POST /auth/verify/code`: Verifies codes submitted by users
   
2. **Service Integration**:
   - Verification service connected to API endpoints
   - Session integration for MFA status tracking
   - Tenant-aware context for multi-tenancy support
   
3. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Unit tests for verification service functionality
   - Integration tests for verification and session interaction
   - API endpoint tests with mock services and repositories
   - Shared mock implementations for consistent testing

## Core Features

The implementation provides the following features:

- **Multiple Verification Methods**: Both Email and SMS channels are supported
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory and database rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Security Controls**: Code expiry, maximum attempts, and invalidation logic
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All verification codes are tenant-specific
- **Session MFA Status**: Sessions track MFA status (None, Pending, Verified, Failed)
- **Provider Abstraction**: Pluggable providers for Email (SMTP, SendGrid) and SMS (Twilio, Vonage)

## Usage Example

To use Email verification in the login flow:

1. User logs in with username/password
2. Backend creates a session with MFA status "Pending"
3. Frontend requests verification code:
   ```
   POST /auth/verify/send
   {
     "user_id": "user-uuid",
     "verification_type": "email",
     "recipient": "user@example.com",
     "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
     "session_token": "session-token"
   }
   ```
4. User receives code via email and submits it:
   ```
   POST /auth/verify/code
   {
     "user_id": "user-uuid",
     "code": "123456",
     "verification_type": "email",
     "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
     "session_token": "session-token"
   }
   ```
5. On success, session MFA status is updated to "Verified"
6. User gains access to protected resources

## Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, validation, and response formatting
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic for code generation, storage, and verification
3. **Repository Layer**: Persists verification codes with tenant isolation
4. **Provider Layer**: Abstracts message delivery mechanisms

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Invalid verification codes
- Expired codes
- Rate limiting violations
- Maximum attempts exceeded
- Sender system failures
- Session validation errors

Each error is mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes and standardized error responses.

## Next Steps

1. **UI Implementation**: Create user interface components for verification flow
2. **Documentation**: Add OpenAPI documentation for the verification endpoints
3. **Security Review**: Conduct security audit of the verification system
4. **Performance Testing**: Test under load to ensure rate limiting works correctly
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for verification success/failure rates
